\subsection{Detailed Description}
this is the equilibration parameter struct for equilibration runs; it's dedicated to the legendary Chu, a rather nocturnal creature who creates bizarre code structures using arcane variable names in great redundancy; although rarely seen these days, the Chu had a considerable influence on the evolution of this code; alas, most of his workings have been un-\/ done, most of his beautifully intertwined loops have vanished and most of the redundancy has been sacrificed to the gods of parallel computing on the great altar of the Emacs-\/Cmd-\/K; up to this day, some people still lament that although the code might be leaner and cleaner than in the old days, some of its soul and charm was lost in those two months of the Great and Awful Cleaning that got rid of most of the traces the Chu had left around these files; Chu: may the goto be (gone) with you and may you find a well-\/paid job that does not involve writing code that other people ever, ever have to use! 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
