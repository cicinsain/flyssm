\subsection{Detailed Description}
Store facts data. The idea is to encode sparse data against non-\/sparse v\mbox{[}index\mbox{]} state arrays. This will in most of the present cases use more memory, but that won't always be true. Also, it is more convenient for those 'don't care' points. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
