THIS IS THE LATEST VERSION OF OUR SIMULATED ANNEALING OPTIMIZATION CODE!!!

INSTALLATION
----------------
(1) install OPENMPI, GSL and SUNDIALS first
(2) go to trunk folder
(3) make the MPICC variable in Makefile point to your OPENMPI mpicc compiler
(3a) if GSL or SUNDIALS libraries are not installed in /usr/local, then you should point
to them by adding -L/your/lib/folder1 -L/your/lib/folder2 to the CLFLAGS variable in Makefile
(3b) if GSL or SUNDIALS includes are not installed in /usr/local, then you should point
to them by adding -I/your/include/folder1 -I/your/include/folder2 to the INCLUDES variable in Makefile
(4) $make deps
(5) $make

CLEANING
---------------
'make clean' -> after cleaning you need to recompile with 'make'
'make veryclean' -> after verycleaning you need to regenerate dependencies with 'make deps' and then recompile with 'make'

PENALTY SECTIONS
----------------
penalty data sections are now renamed to penalty_data.x, external_penalty_data.x, maternal_penalty_data.x where x is the number of the genotype, 
starting from 0. So if we have:

$genotypes
bias_wt     facts_wt    bcd_wt      hist_wt     ext_wt      weights_wt      WWWW
bias_tllg   facts_tllg  bcd_tllg	hist_tllg	ext_tllg	weights_tllg	WWWW
$$

for wildtype data we will have x=0, and for tllg data x=1. In accordance with that, the sections with the penalties for the external data
will be named $external_penalty_data.0 for wildtype and $external_penalty_data.1 for tllg.

So sections like $external_penalty_data.WWWW will not be recognized by the code anymore.
